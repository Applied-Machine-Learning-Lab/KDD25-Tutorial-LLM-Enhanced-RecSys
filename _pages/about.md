## Abstract
Due to the brilliant abilities in reasoning and understanding, the Large Language Model (LLM) has revolutionized the pattern of several fields, including recommender systems (RS). There have been a handful of research that focuses on empowering the RS by LLM. Recently, considering the latency and memory costs in real-world applications, LLM-Enhanced RS (LLMERS) is highlighted. This direction pushes the LLM into the online system with a large step by eliminating the utilization of LLM during inference. However, it is a rather cutting-edge field, and a comprehensive tutorial is desirable to conclude this direction. In this tutorial, we investigate the most up-to-date works of LLM-enhanced RS to boost this direction. Based on the component of an RS model that the LLM aims to augment, the basic taxonomy includes Knowledge Enhancement, Interaction Enhancement and Model Enhancement. In each basic cluster, we identify and summarize what and how to augment the traditional RS. Besides, for further advancements in both industrial and academic fields, we give out its applications and several promising directions. A [repository](https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/Awesome-LLM-Enhanced-Recommender-Systems) is released to facilitate access to the surveyed papers.

<!-- ## Submission Instructions

All submissions (.pdf format) must be written in English and use the latest template of ACM SIGIR 2025 available at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). The concepts and keywords are required. Submissions can be of varying length from 4 to 9 pages. References do not count against the page limit. All submissions must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. 

Papers that include text generated from a large language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their own text (e.g., automate grammar checks, word autocorrect, and other editing work), but text “produced entirely” by AI is not allowed. 

All submissions will be double-blind peer reviewed by the program committee and judged by their relevance to the workshop, scientific novelty, and technical quality. 

Please note that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper either remotely or on location (strongly preferred). 

We encourage but do not require authors to release any code and/or datasets associated with their paper.
